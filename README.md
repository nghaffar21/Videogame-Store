# Videogame Store

A software written in C++ and using PostgreSQL. It simulates a videogame distribution system(like Steam and Playstore).

This project was a teamwork of me and two of my classmates. We applied the three phases of traditional(Non-agile) software project development:

1 - Specification(Requirements Analysis, Design of Class diagram, Sequence diagrams, and Use-case diagrams)

2 - Design(User Interface Design, Layered Architecture using Facade Controller: Presentation, Domain, and Data layers)

3 - Implementation(Use of Transaction Script Pattern, Database Design in PostgreSQL, Write C++ code, Connect the C++ project with the Database using pqxx)

## Compile and Run

To run the program, first you must have the local database setup as the diagram above. Then you can go to Sistema_Videojocs_Nima_Arturo_Eric -> x64 -> Debug -> Sistema_Videojocs.
